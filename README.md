Hi, I’m Shashank Ramesh.
I am pursuing my Master's degree in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
I’m interested in computational physics and astrophysics
I’m currently working on Galaxy Evolution through N-body simulations
I’m looking for projects at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology and computational physics.
